This project investigates whether demographic and gaming behavior data can predict if someone plays League of Legends. Using video_games.csv on Kaggle, I applied Naive Bayes (both categorical and Gaussian) and Random Forest models to classify a new person. Perfect for anyone who wants to learn the underlying process of R Studio e1071 naiveBayes model.

The whole code is written in R tudio.

The data set I use is from Kaggle. Here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mzkjess/gaming-behavior-and-demographics-dataset

I also included the data set in the files, called "video_games.csv".
