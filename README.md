# Guideline

This project investigates whether demographic and gaming behavior data can predict if someone plays League of Legends. Using `video_games.csv` from Kaggle, I applied **Naive Bayes** (both categorical and Gaussian) and Random Forest models to classify a new person.

Perfect for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of the `e1071::naiveBayes()` model in R Studio.
