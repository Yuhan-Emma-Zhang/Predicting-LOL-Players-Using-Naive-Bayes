# Predicting-LOL-Players-Using-Naive-Bayes
This project investigates whether demographic and gaming behavior data can predict if someone plays League of Legends. Using video_games.csv on Kaggle, I applied Naive Bayes (both categorical and Gaussian) and Random Forest models to classify a new person. Perfect for anyone who wants to learn the underlying process of R Studio naiveBayes model.
